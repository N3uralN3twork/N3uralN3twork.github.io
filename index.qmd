**Hello there.**

My name is *Matthias* and I am a data analyst currently working in the insurance industry.

I am an analytically minded developer with 5 years of experience in data analysis and 2 years of experience in model building. I hold a Master of Science in mathematics with a specialization in statistics, where I created software in Python for analyzing the validity of clustering models.

## Goals

My goals for this website are to learn more about frontend development as well as new technologies, like [Quarto](https://quarto.org/ "Quarto"). I also wanted to have a more interactive method of discovering and keep track of my projects; opposed to the current method of static Word documents and mono repositories.

## What is Quarto?

Quarto helps you have your ideas and your code in one place, and present it in a beautiful way.

**Quarto unifies and extends the RMarkdown ecosystem** - it unifies by combining the functionality of R Markdown, bookdown, distill, xaringian, etc into a single consistent system. And it extends in several ways: all features are possible beyond R too, including Python and Javascript. It also has more "guardrails": accessibility and inclusion are centered in the design. Quarto is for people who love RMarkdown, and it's for people who have never used RMarkdown.
