Learn the basics of a logistic regression\n2.  Learn how to implement logistic regression in R with Caret\n\n# Notes:\n\n-   Logistic Regression is suited for categorical response variables and one or more predictor variables.\n-   $Log(Odds) = \\beta1*X1+...\\beta N*Xn$\n-   The log(odds) ratio is $ln[p/(1-p)]$\n-   Predicted probability of an event occurring: $p = 1/(1+\\exp^{-z})$\n\nThis project will be using the *German Credit* dataset from the caret package. Goal is to predict whether a consumer is good or bad for business.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(stats)\n```\n:::\n",
