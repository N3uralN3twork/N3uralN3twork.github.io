::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
## GOAL

Produce the same schema that you have, which represents the desired study design. The input to your programs should be the parameters of # of sites, # of subjects/site, a randomization ratio, and various stratification levels.

## RESULT

A reactive application that creates a design schema, given the researchers design parameters. 

This project was finished in about 5 weeks.

Let's say we're a researcher interested in deciding which treatment to give to our target audience. Since we want to make sure we follow proper guidelines, we decide to reach out to a friend of ours, a statistician, for advice.

She says that a good practice would be to create a credible, experimental design to find what we're looking for. This project is essentially a reproducible example of our goals with the following condition:

1. Write a completely randomized design schema for $S$ subjects at $T$ sites in blocks of $B$ where randomization is $N:D$ in terms of treatment to control.

### Running Example:
$30$ subjects at site one in blocks of $6$ where the randomization of treatment to control is $1:1$

### Solution:
Setting a seed is necessary for reproducibility.

Also, having explainable code was a requirement for this project, as the client may have wanted to know how to make changes in the future.
