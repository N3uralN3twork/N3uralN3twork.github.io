[Logistic Regression](https://www.r-bloggers.com/evaluating-logistic-regression-models/)

# Goals:

1.  Learn the basics of a logistic regression
2.  Learn how to implement logistic regression in R with Caret

# Notes:

-   Logistic Regression is suited for categorical response variables and one or more predictor variables.
-   $Log(Odds) = \beta1*X1+...\beta N*Xn$
-   The log(odds) ratio is $ln[p/(1-p)]$
-   Predicted probability of an event occurring: $p = 1/(1+\exp^{-z})$

This project will be using the *German Credit* dataset from the caret package. Goal is to predict whether a consumer is good or bad for business.

```{r, echo = TRUE, warning=FALSE}
library(stats)
```
