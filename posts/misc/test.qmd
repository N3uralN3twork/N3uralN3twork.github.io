:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
## GOAL

This project will focus on the famous XGBoost system and its application on a moderately large dataset. Starting with a history of the system, then exploring the algorithm itself, and finally ending with an application to forest cover types, this project will hopefully provide a framework on which to base further research and applications.
