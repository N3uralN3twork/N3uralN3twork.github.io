And it extends in several ways: all features are possible beyond R too, including Python and Javascript. It also has more “guardrails”: accessibility and inclusion are centered in the design. Quarto is for people who love RMarkdown, and it’s for people who have never used RMarkdown."

    "title": "Cluster Validity Indices",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The following research examines various clustering methods and internal validity indices. Many clustering algorithms depend on various assumptions in order to identify subgroups, so there exists a need to objectively evaluate these algorithms, whether through complexity analyses or the proposed internal validity indices. The goal is to apply these indices to both artificial and real data in order to assess their fidelity. Currently, there exists no Python package to achieve this goal, but the proposed library offers 31 indices to help the user choose the correct number of clusters in his/her data, regardless of the chosen clustering methodology.\n\n\nThe goal of this project is to understand and compute a variety of indices that indicate the optimal number of clusters to use when performing a cluster analysis.\nCluster analysis refers to a finding unique subgroup/clusters in a dataset where the observations within each cluster are more related to each other in some way compared to observations in another, separate cluster. There are a plethora of clustering techniques and algorithms, each with a different way of solving the above general problem. In addition, there does not exist a single, optimal clustering solution for any clustering problem. This is also known as the “No Free Lunch” theorem from David Wolpert and William Macready, which states that “any two optimization algorthims are equivalent when their performance is averaged across all possible problems.” (Wolpert, Macready, 2005)\nSince cluster analysis is inherently an unsupervised learning technique, the selection of the optimal number of clusters is subjective. Consider the following example that was made via Python:\n\n\nCode\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_blobs\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\ndata, true_labels = make_blobs(n_samples=500, n_features=2, centers = 4, random_state=1234, cluster_std=0.9)\n\npoints = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['x', 'y'])\n\nk4 = KMeans(n_clusters=4, random_state=1234).fit(points)\nk5 = KMeans(n_clusters=5, random_state=1234).fit(points)\nk6 = KMeans(n_clusters=6, random_state=1234).fit(points)\n\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(12, 12))\nax1 = fig.add_subplot(221)\nax2 = fig.add_subplot(222)\nax3 = fig.add_subplot(223)\nax4 = fig.add_subplot(224)\n\nax1.scatter(points['x'], points['y'], color=\"black\")\nax1.axes.get_xaxis().set_visible(False)\nax1.axes.get_yaxis().set_visible(False)\nax2.scatter(points['x'], points['y'], c=k4.labels_.astype(float))\nax2.axes.get_xaxis().set_visible(False)\nax2.axes.get_yaxis().set_visible(False)\nax3.scatter(points['x'], points['y'], c=k5.labels_.astype(float))\nax3.axes.get_xaxis().set_visible(False)\nax3.axes.get_yaxis().set_visible(False)\nax4.scatter(points['x'], points['y'], c=k6.labels_.astype(float))\nax4.axes.get_xaxis().set_visible(False)\nax4.axes.get_yaxis().set_visible(False)\n\nax1.title.set_text('Original Data')\nax2.title.set_text('K=4 Clusters')\nax3.title.set_text('K=5 Clusters')\nax4.title.set_text('K=6 Clusters')\n\nplt.show()\n\n\nC:\\Users\\miqui\\anaconda3\\envs\\MLDL\\lib\\site-packages\\sklearn\\cluster\\_kmeans.py:1334: UserWarning:\n\nKMeans is known to have a memory leak on Windows with MKL, when there are less chunks than available threads.

These seemingly simple requests can have a profound effect on where business leaders decide to go with a project, if at all. Thus, the reasoning behind this calculator is to provide people with a no-code interface to some common statistical tests.\nA couple of months ago (2022), I was asked to give a few presentations to my team and a couple of outside business folks on how to properly conduct a power analysis. I wasn’t the strongest at performing such tests, as I had no formal training on how to do one and was taught more theoretical aspects, but I went ahead and researched on my own. Along the way, I began to realize that - unless you know what you’re doing - it was very easy to be given some sample numbers and given an output. Unfortunately, the validity of the inputs was not always bulletproof. Sometimes, the requester wasn’t quite sure of the numbers he/she was presenting, so it would lead to some discussions around his/her purposes.\nThe most difficult part of the project was figuring out the UI, as I was inspired by G*Power’s user interface, but I didn’t necessarily want a straight copy. So, I settled for a seemingly simple approach.\nHonestly, the most difficult steps are 2 and 3, as mentioned earlier. Thus, it’s imperative that a user understands what he/she is doing before receiving the results. As an example, a request was made to me to figure out how many days an A/B test would have to run to provide statistically significant results. I performed a power analysis and came back with my estimate on how long it would take to achieve a provable result.\n35 \\ days\nAs it turns out, upon further questioning, the requester told me that the test was only going to run for a maximum of 30 days. There wasn’t any way for results to be statistically verifiable. Instead of lying to her, I was upfront and told her that she wasn’t going to get what she wanted in just 30 days, which paid off for me in the end. She understood what I said after just a little more convincing, and the sandbox went off without any problems."

    "text": "Decision Trees\nDecision Trees are simple clustering algorithms that split the predictor space into distinct, non-overlapping regions.Trees are easy to visualize, are flexible since they make no assumption about the functional form, and can model highly non-linear relationships.They can also be used in the context of regression and classification.\nGenerally speaking, the algorithm works by searching through the available predictors and selecting the one that splits the leads to the greatest reduction in residual sums of squares (RSS), called recursive binary splitting.However, the model does not look beyond a single split to see if other predictors may lead to a greater overall reduction of RSS over the course of many splits.This is called a greedy algorithm. Considering the image below, we see that decision trees are a top-down approach, meaning that they start with the full predictor space then, moving down, create rules that split the space into distinct regions. The end result is a set divided predictor space of non-overlapping regions, as seen on the left. The splitting process continues until a criterion is met, whether it be a defined maximal depth, number of observations per leaf, or number of observations per split.\n\n\n\nBishop 2006 from 2 Charles U ML reference\n\n\nTree pruning is a method that can improve the predictive accuracy of decision trees. Pruning refers to the reduction in depth of the tree. One concern about decision trees is over-fitting by modeling noise or being too complex. Utilizing a process known as cost complexity pruning, the optimal tree depth may be determined.This process considers the prediction error and the number of terminal nodes, as illustrated in the equation below.Cost complexity pruning aims to minimize this equation. The tuning parameter, \\alpha, controls the complexity, or depth, of the tree. A large \\alpha will result in a deep, complex tree (less pruning) and a small will result in a shallow tree (more pruning). In general, shallow trees cannot model all of the patterns in the data and will have higher prediction error at the cost of low complexity.Deep trees can model the patterns in the data at the cost of high complexity and potential over-fitting.There exists a happy medium between the two.\nClassification requires small modifications to the fitting process compared to regression. Notably, instead of considering RSS, classification trees may consider either classification error, entropy, or the Gini Index.When the goal of modelling is prediction accuracy, it is generally advisable to minimize classification error for the splits. Classification error looks at the proportion of observations in each region belonging to a certain class and compares this to the most common classification of observations in that region. The equation below is used to calculate the classification error given region m and class k. \nCE = 1 - max(\\hat{p}_{mk})\n\nEntropy and the Gini Index are most commonly used for classification and are very similar in that they consider node purity. Node purity refers to the assortment of observations in a node. If all of the observations in a node have the same class label, then it is said to have high purity. If there are many different observation classes in a node, then it is not pure.High node purity is generally preferred. The equations for entropy and Gini Index are below.Just as regression trees aim to minimize RSS, classification trees aim to minimize entropy and Gini.\n\nG = \\Large \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\hat{p}_{mk} (1 - \\hat{p}_{mk})\n\n\nE = \\Large - \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\hat{p}_{mk} log(\\hat{p}_{mk})\n\nDecision trees can be advantageous since they are easy to interpret and can model a variety of data types. However, they have some weaknesses. A primary weakness is that they can have a high degree of variance.Another weakness is that they are not robust in the sense that the addition/removal of a single observation may result in a very different tree shape.There are several ways to handle these concerns, commonly bagging, random forests, and boosting. We will discuss boosting, in particular."

    "section": "Boosting",
    "text": "Boosting\nBoosting is a general ensemble algorithm that can be used to improve the predictive accuracy of decision trees. Boosting assumes a generic function then fits a shallow tree of the residuals. After incorporating the new tree to get an updated function, another shallow tree is fit to the updated function’s residuals.This process repeats until a criterion is met. Just like decision trees, the final resulting model is a single tree.\nThe boosting algorithm has three main steps:\n\nDefine an initial model to be fit to the data.\nIteratively fit B-many shallow trees to the residuals of the previous model and add them to the previous model\n\nFit a tree with d-many splits to the prior model’s residuals\nUpdate the previous model by adding a shrunken version of the shallow tree.\nUpdate the residuals by subtracting the shrunken version of the shallow tree\n\nAfter B-many shallow trees have been fit to the residuals, the result is a single boosted model.\n\nFrom the algorithm, we can see that the boosted model is a single tree that consists of a collection of weak learners (shallow trees). It is powerful because it can control for both bias and variance. Each addition of a weak learner aims to reduce the bias of the model. The collection of weak learners has the effect of reducing the variance of the model. Even though it controls for both, most of the focus is on bias reduction.If the initial function in the first step of the algorithm is \\hat{f}_{x} , then the initial residuals are the y-values.When this is the case, the final boosted model will be the following equation, where \\hat{f_{b}}(x) is the weak-learning decision tree from each iteration.\n\n\\Large \\hat{f}(x) = \\sum_{b=1}^{B} \\lambda \\hat{f_{b}}(x)\n\nThere are three tuning parameters for boosting: B, , and d. The parameter B represents the number of shallow trees that will be fit to the residuals. This value should be determined using cross-validation since a large value may result in over-fitting. The parameter B is closely tied to the shrinkage parameter . The parameter is called the shrinkage parameter and this controls the rate at which the model learns. A small lambda value confers a small adjustment to each sequential model. If the value of is extremely small, the model will need a large value for B in order for the data to be fit accurately. The parameter d defines the number of splits in each of the shallow trees. When we are referring to these sequentially added shallow trees, we mean that the value of d is small.\nThere are several algorithms for implementing boosting. Some example algorithms are AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost (there are others). AdaBoost is commonly recognized as the first algorithm that successfully implemented the boosting algorithm. Gradient Boosting is a generalization of AdaBoost, and XGBoost is an optimized gradient boosting algorithm. One problem with boosting is that it can be very slow, especially for large datasets. This is part of the reason why XGBoost has become so popular.\n\nXGBoost\nThere are many algorithms to implement boosting. The first boosting algorithm is recognized as AdaBoost and was mostly used for binary classification. Gradient Boosting is a generalization of AdaBoost and allows for the use of different loss functions. This improvement meant that it could be applied to regression and multi-class classification problems.One issue with Gradient Boosting, which is common among boosting in general, is that the learning process can be very slow.XGBoost is an improved implementation of the Gradient Boosting algorithm optimized for speed and accuracy.It is optimized for speed and has been observed to be more accurate in many cases, which is how it got its name: eXtreme Gradient Boosting. The success of XGBoost is attributed to several key algorithmic improvements:\n\n\nRegularized learning objective\nNovel tree-based algorithm for handling sparse data\nWeighted quantile sketch for learning\nOptimized computer hardware utilization\n\nTo implement a boosting algorithm, there is a chosen loss function (usually based on prediction error) that gets minimized. Gradient Boosting uses gradients to accomplish this. XGBoost improves upon this process by\n\nXGBoost uses regularization of the loss function. Briefly, boosting works by iteratively adding weak learner shallow trees. This improvement helps to prevent over fitting by smoothing the solutions of terminal nodes in the shallow trees that are used for boosting.Regularization works by adding a penalty to a traditional loss function, usually based on errors or residuals. Common types of regularization are the l1 and l2 regularization.The loss function used by XGBoost is given below.The first term is a loss function that measures the difference between the predicted and actual values of y.The second term is the regularization term, or penalty, and uses both l1 and l2 regularization.The penalty works by reducing the complexity of the model.This rationale is analogous to cost complexity pruning in decision trees.There are alternative methods for regularization, but this method has been shown to be easier to implement for parallelization.Note that when the regularization term is set to zero, the loss function is identical to traditional gradient boosting.\n\n\n\\Large L = \\sum_{i}l(y_{i'}, \\hat{y_{i}}) + \\sum_{k}(\\gamma T + \\frac {1}{2} \\lambda ||w||^{2})\n\nThe second major improvement on boosting is the use of second-order derivatives in the optimization of the loss function.The use of second-derivatives yields more information about how to minimize the loss function faster.Usually for large datasets, it is not possible to explore all possible tree structures. Therefore, the use of the second derivative helps to pick which splits are optimal.The loss function cannot be optimized using traditional methods.The designers of XGBoost proposed an additive training strategy that necessitates the use of the second derivative for large datasets.\nA third major feature is shrinkage and feature sub-sampling to prevent over-fitting.Shrinkage refers to the parameter used in the boosting algorithm described in the previous section. Feature sub-sampling is a technique that refers to the construction of the shallow trees during boosting.When these trees are constructed, at each split, only a fraction of the total features are considered.Random forests are known for employing this methodology as it decorrelates successive trees and allows for different patterns to be captured.\nThere are several splitting algorithms incorporated into the function that can be defined by the user.These splitting algorithms are listed below.\n\nExact Greedy Algorithm: This algorithm considers all of the possible splits for the features and picks a split based on the greatest reduction in the loss function.For continuous variables, the observations are sorted in ascending order then calculates split statistics (such as Sum of Squared Errors)between each observation.For n-many observations and m-many features, there are (n-1) possible splits per feature and m(n-1) possible splits. For large datasets, this is infeasible and requires the use of the approximate algorithm.\nApproximate Algorithm: This algorithm improves upon the exact greedy algorithm and can work with large datasets.Instead of exploring all possible splits, the algorithm proposes split points based on quantiles and maps continuous features to these “bins”.Split statistics are calculated for the bins as a whole and then the split point is chosen based on which was best. The quantile strategy is distributable and recomputable, meaning it is faster.The designers also showed that this approximate quantile strategy can yield similar predictive performance as models that use the exact strategy. This quantile strategy is called weighted quantile sketch, and can be used for weighted data.\nSparsity-Aware Split Finding: Many datasets contain sparse data (such as missing data and zero-entries from one-hot encoding or other values). By incorporating a pattern recognition algorithm for sparse data, the model can run much faster for datasets with lots of sparse data.XGBoost assigns a default direction to each node when it is sparse.This “unified” approach allows for faster computation times.\n\n\nThe final improvement for XGBoost is the system optimization.Tree construction and sorting data (during the splitting algorithm) are the most computationally intensive and time consuming. Large datasets may not always be able to be modeled on a device. XGBoost was designed to be able to work efficiently on any device and in parallel with other devices in a distributed manner.To take the most advantage of a computer system, large datasets need to first be divided into blocks of data. XGBoost utilizes the following computational system improvements:\n\nColumn Block for Parallel Learning - To reduce the time of sorting, data is stored in blocks and only sorted once. The data is stored in a compressed column format.\nParallelization - The data blocks are distributed among the CPU cores. Therefore, collecting statistics from columns can be done using a parallel algorithm for finding splits.\nDistributed Computing - Blocking the data allows for it to be distributed among different machines or disks. This allows the model to work on large datasets.\nCache Awareness - Storing gradient statistics in the cache of a CPU is computationally more efficient.\nBlocks for Out-of-Core Computation - Dividing the data into blocks and using computer science techniques known as block compression and sharding allows for the model to work with very large datasets.\n\nIn summary, XGBoost is a gradient boosting algorithm that is designed for speed and scalability.It incorporates many different algorithms that the user can choose to use depending on their data structure.XGBoost is commonly used to take advantage of these design features and has been shown to perform just as well, oftentimes better, than other gradient boosting algorithms"

The dataset contains a total of 54 features because some of the variables are one-hot encoded, however, there are only 13 truly unique features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable Name\nType\nMeasurement Unit\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nElevation\nQuantitative\nMeters\nElevation in Meters\n\n\nAspect\nQuantitative\nAzimuthal Angle\nAspect in Degrees Azimuth\n\n\nSlope\nQuantitative\nDegrees\nSlope in Degrees\n\n\nHorizontal Distance to Hydrology\nQuantitative\nMeters\nHorizontal distance to nearest surface water features\n\n\nVertical Distance to Hydrology\nQuantitative\nMeters\nVertical distance to nearest surface water features\n\n\nHorizontal Distance to Roadways\nQuantitative\nMeters\nHorizontal distance to nearest roadway\n\n\nHillshade 9 AM\nQuantitative\n0-255 Index\nHillshade index at 9 AM, during summer solstice\n\n\nHillshade Noon\nQuantitative\n0-255 Index\nHillshade index at noon, during summer solstice\n\n\nHillshade 3 PM\nQuantitative\n0-255 Index\nHillshade index at 3 PM, during summer solstice\n\n\nHorizontal Distance to Fire Points\nQuantitative\nMeters\nHorizontal distance to nearest wildfire ignition points\n\n\nWilderness Area\nQualitative\n0 (absent), 1 (present)\nWilderness area designation\n\n\nSoil Type\nQualitative\n0 (absent), 1 (present)\nSoil type designation\n\n\nCover Type\nInteger\n1 to 7\nForest cover type designation\n\n\n\nThe data was collected from four different wilderness areas (out of a total 6 wilderness areas) within the Roosevelt National Forest in Northern Colorado.The cover type was determined by the US Forest Service Region 2 Resource Information System data. A wilderness area is an area that is relatively untouched by humans; this means that any ecological processes are the result of nature rather than forest management services. The four wilderness areas studied in Roosevelt National Forest were Neota, Rawah, Comanche, and Cache la Poudre. These four areas differ in elevation and geography, even though they are nearby, resulting in different species of trees covering the land.Neota consists mostly of spruce/fir.Rawah and Comanche are mostly lodgepole pine, with a smattering of spruce/fir and aspen. Cache la Poudre consists mostly of Ponderosa Pine, Douglas/Fir, and Cottonwood/Willow. It should be noted that approximately 85% of the observations consist of two types of classes.There are no missing values.\nTables 1-2 and Figure 1 show some frequency distributions of the cover types and wilderness areas. From these, it can be seen that the dataset is dominated by the two cover types and two wilderness areas. This is attributable to the relative sizes of the wilderness areas. It is important to note the imbalance of observations as this may impact the bias of the model. The Rawah wilderness area is approximately 119.4 sq. miles; the Neota wilderness area is approximately 15.5 sq. miles; the Comanche wilderness area is approximately 104.4 sq. miles; the Cache la Poudre wilderness area is approximately 14.5 sq. miles. From Figure 1, there is a significant proportion of the total observations (approximately 20%) that are in the same soil type and cover type. Figure 2 displays a matrix of correlation values between all of the numeric variables. No significant conclusions regarding the relationship between variables can be concluded. Figure 3 shows that elevation does a great job distinguishing between the cover types. Other variables were explored, but there were no significant patterns identified.\n\nTable 2: A table of observation frequencies shows that the observations are dominated by Spruce/Fir and Lodgepole Pine.\n\n\nClass\nCover Type\nFrequency\nRelative Frequency\n\n\n\n\n1\nSpruce/fir\n211840\n0.365\n\n\n2\nLodgepole Pine\n283301\n0.488\n\n\n3\nPonderosa Pine\n35754\n0.062\n\n\n4\nCottonwood/Willow\n2747\n0.005\n\n\n5\nAspen\n9493\n0.016\n\n\n6\nDouglas/fir\n17367\n0.03\n\n\n7\nKrummholz\n20510\n0.035\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: A table of wilderness area frequencies shows that approximately 88% of the observations came from two of the four areas.\n\n\nWilderness Area\nFrequency\n\n\n\n\nRawah\n260796\n\n\nNeota\n29884\n\n\nComanche Peak\n253364\n\n\nCache la Poudre\n36968"

In PyTorch, we use tensors to encode the inputs and outputs of a model, as well as the model’s parameters.\nTensors are similar to NumPy’s <https://numpy.org/>_ ndarrays, except that tensors can run on GPUs or other hardware accelerators. In fact, tensors and NumPy arrays can often share the same underlying memory, eliminating the need to copy data (see bridge-to-np-label). Tensors are also optimized for automatic differentiation (we’ll see more about that later in the Autograd <autograd_tutorial.html>__ section). If you’re familiar with ndarrays, you’ll be right at home with the Tensor API. If not, follow along!\n\n\nCode\nimport torch\nimport numpy as np\n\n\nInitializing a Tensor ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nTensors can be initialized in various ways. Take a look at the following examples:\nDirectly from data\nTensors can be created directly from data. The data type is automatically inferred.\n\n\nCode\ndata = [[1, 2],[3, 4]]\nx_data = torch.tensor(data)\n\n\nFrom a NumPy array\nTensors can be created from NumPy arrays (and vice versa - see bridge-to-np-label).\n\n\nCode\nnp_array = np.array(data)\nx_np = torch.from_numpy(np_array)\n\n\nFrom another tensor:\nThe new tensor retains the properties (shape, datatype) of the argument tensor, unless explicitly overridden.\n\n\nCode\nx_ones = torch.ones_like(x_data) # retains the properties of x_data\nprint(f\"Ones Tensor: \\n {x_ones} \\n\")\n\nx_rand = torch.rand_like(x_data, dtype=torch.float) # overrides the datatype of x_data\nprint(f\"Random Tensor: \\n {x_rand} \\n\")\n\n\nWith random or constant values:\nshape is a tuple of tensor dimensions. In the functions below, it determines the dimensionality of the output tensor.\n\n\nCode\nshape = (2,3,)\nrand_tensor = torch.rand(shape)\nones_tensor = torch.ones(shape)\nzeros_tensor = torch.zeros(shape)\n\nprint(f\"Random Tensor: \\n {rand_tensor} \\n\")\nprint(f\"Ones Tensor: \\n {ones_tensor} \\n\")\nprint(f\"Zeros Tensor: \\n {zeros_tensor}\")\n\n\n\nAttributes of a Tensor ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nTensor attributes describe their shape, datatype, and the device on which they are stored.\n\n\nCode\ntensor = torch.rand(3,4)\n\nprint(f\"Shape of tensor: {tensor.shape}\")\nprint(f\"Datatype of tensor: {tensor.dtype}\")\nprint(f\"Device tensor is stored on: {tensor.device}\")\n\n\n\nOperations on Tensors ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nOver 100 tensor operations, including arithmetic, linear algebra, matrix manipulation (transposing, indexing, slicing), sampling and more are comprehensively described here <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.html>__.\nEach of these operations can be run on the GPU (at typically higher speeds than on a CPU). If you’re using Colab, allocate a GPU by going to Runtime > Change runtime type > GPU.\nBy default, tensors are created on the CPU. We need to explicitly move tensors to the GPU using .to method (after checking for GPU availability). Keep in mind that copying large tensors across devices can be expensive in terms of time and memory!\n\n\nCode\n# We move our tensor to the GPU if available\nif torch.cuda.is_available():\n  tensor = tensor.to('cuda')\n\n\nTry out some of the operations from the list. If you’re familiar with the NumPy API, you’ll find the Tensor API a breeze to use.\nStandard numpy-like indexing and slicing:\n\n\nCode\ntensor = torch.ones(4, 4)\nprint('First row: ',tensor[0])\nprint('First column: ', tensor[:, 0])\nprint('Last column:', tensor[..., -1])\ntensor[:,1] = 0\nprint(tensor)\n\n\nJoining tensors You can use torch.cat to concatenate a sequence of tensors along a given dimension. See also torch.stack <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.stack.html>__, another tensor joining op that is subtly different from torch.cat.\n\n\nCode\nt1 = torch.cat([tensor, tensor, tensor], dim=1)\nprint(t1)\n\n\nArithmetic operations\n\n\nCode\n# This computes the matrix multiplication between two tensors. y1, y2, y3 will have the same value\ny1 = tensor @ tensor.T\ny2 = tensor.matmul(tensor.T)\n\ny3 = torch.rand_like(tensor)\ntorch.matmul(tensor, tensor.T, out=y3)\n\n\n# This computes the element-wise product. z1, z2, z3 will have the same value\nz1 = tensor * tensor\nz2 = tensor.mul(tensor)\n\nz3 = torch.rand_like(tensor)\ntorch.mul(tensor, tensor, out=z3)\n\n\nSingle-element tensors If you have a one-element tensor, for example by aggregating all values of a tensor into one value, you can convert it to a Python numerical value using item():\n\n\nCode\nagg = tensor.sum()\nagg_item = agg.item()  \nprint(agg_item, type(agg_item))\n\n\nIn-place operations Operations that store the result into the operand are called in-place. They are denoted by a _ suffix. For example: x.copy_(y), x.t_(), will change x.\n\n\nCode\nprint(tensor, \"\\n\")\ntensor.add_(5)\nprint(tensor)\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIn-place operations save some memory, but can be problematic when computing derivatives because of an immediate loss of history. Hence, their use is discouraged.\n\n\n\nBridge with NumPy ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Tensors on the CPU and NumPy arrays can share their underlying memory locations, and changing one will change the other.\nTensor to NumPy array ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n\nCode\nt = torch.ones(5)\nprint(f\"t: {t}\")\nn = t.numpy()\nprint(f\"n: {n}\")\n\n\nA change in the tensor reflects in the NumPy array.\n\n\nCode\nt.add_(1)\nprint(f\"t: {t}\")\nprint(f\"n: {n}\")\n\n\nNumPy array to Tensor ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n\nCode\nn = np.ones(5)\nt = torch.from_numpy(n)\n\n\nChanges in the NumPy array reflects in the tensor.\n\n\nCode\nnp.add(n, 1, out=n)\nprint(f\"t: {t}\")\nprint(f\"n: {n}\")"
