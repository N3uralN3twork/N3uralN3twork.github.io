### Matthias Quinn

::: {#hero-heading}
I am currently a data analyst (or scientist, depending on the project) working in the insurance industry. I've still have a lot to learn before I'm ready to transition to a full data science position, but I'm confident that - in the coming years - I'll be able to fully qualify for such a role at Progressive.

### Remarks

I also used to be a researcher that worked on developing a better understanding of a social phenomenon called the `school-to-prison pipeline`. It sounds depressing, but that's because it really is.

In my free time, I work on projects like this website and - as of Oct. 3rd, 2022 - [a project for performance metrics](https://github.com/thieu1995/permetrics) with researchers from Vietnam. I also enjoy learning about my field and keeping up with current advances in ML and DL. I don't (usually) fully understand what most of the papers are doing, but I make attempts to research topics of interest.
